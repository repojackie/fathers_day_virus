# Father's day virus app
When this app runs, it first displays a single window with the option to click "ok". If the user clicks "ok" or 'x', two new windows will spawn. The windows will continue to spawn as the user presses buttons until the 't' key is pressed, in which a new dialog appears. This new dialog allows the user to safely close all the windows.

# Dependencies 
Python 3.6+
Tkinter [included]
(runs on all platforms)

# Other stuff
This script was made for fathers day, so the naming scheme within the script matches the occasion.
